Backend Overview
Flask API: The backend is built using Flask, which serves as the API layer for the React frontend. It handles various operations such as CRUD operations for books, members, and transactions, as well as custom operations like issuing books or recording returns.

MySQL Database: The data is stored in a MySQL database, with tables likely representing entities like Books, Members, and Transactions. Flask interacts with this database to store and retrieve information as required by the frontend.
